  h3. Hello World

  My new blog is ready and I'm so f*king tired that I just write the necessary Hello thing.

  Firstly I wanted to write about the development of this blog and the VIM autocmd which creates the names for the blog entriesâ€¦ but this need to happend next time, sorry.

  Good night.
