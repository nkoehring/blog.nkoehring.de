h1. How to write an article

Best examples for how to write articles are the existing ones. But to be sure anyone is able to 
write an article:

The naming scheme of every article file is YYYYMMbDDhhmmss_your_nice_headline.haml, simple 
creatable with following command:

  @vim $(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S_my_cool_article.haml')@

Now every article file needs some variables. It is way less painful than it sounds. Look at this 
example:

<pre>
<code>
  - @title = "test article"
  - @abstract = "Hello, I am a test article. My purpose is to test something."
  - @lang = "en"
  - @tags = %w(foo baz)

  :textile
    some more content
</code>
</pre>

The variables are self explaining, aren't they?
Below the line with @:textile@ begins the article itself. Of course @:textile@ is not the only 
markdown HAML understands. You can for example use @:plain@ / @:escaped@ or @:markdown@ or 
@:maruku@. See the "HAML reference":http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html#filters for more information.
